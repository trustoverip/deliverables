## References
### Normative References

```
The policy for reference lists is:
1. `ORG_NAME` documents listed should have at least one approved version – draft-only docs should not be referenced.
Exception exists for documents that will be approved with or after the referenced doc is approved (may be part of same enabler package). In short – approved docs should not reference unapproved docs.
2. When a reference is made to an `ORG_NAME` specification, then Open Manufacturing Platform with the TM symbol (™) should
be used in the description.
3. The name + version (no date) for `ORG_NAME` specifications are generally sufficient – dates should be used only if there is a specific reason to limit the usage.
4. References to other affiliate docs should similarly provide sufficient information to uniquely determine the needed document and should provide the appropriate source information.
5. The URL for `ORG_NAME` material (new `ORG_NAME` and affiliate) should always be http://www.openmanufacturingplatform.org.

Models to use:
	[REFLABEL]	<General Model> "Ref Title", Ref information (source, date, id), URL:http//<ref-source>/
	[`ORG_NAME`DOC]	<`ORG_NAME` Model> "`ORG_NAME` Document Title",{ Version x.y,} Open Manufacturing Platform™, `ORG_NAME` <docname>{    <version>}, URL:http//www.openmobilealliance.org/

If there are no entries in the table – enter ‘none’ to be clear.
